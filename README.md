Support for this particular project has been discontinued due to recent security updates to the Roku networking protocol. 

Legacy copies of this code (strictly for research) can be found in the proper channels

Unfortunately due to legal pressure, and the ethical issues arising from this sideloader. [I threatened with three different lawsuits over this] The code has been reverted to its original AS-IS form and I am unable to make anything available. 

If you are a genuine cybersecurity research with valid credentials, you can contact me on twitter with your research intentions and I may consider giving you the code if it doesn't violate any ethical or legal standards.
